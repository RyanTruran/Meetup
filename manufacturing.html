      <h2>Examples</h2>
      <h3>AGV System</h3>
      <p>
        Explosive Ingredient Delivery System that is used to minimize human exposure to ingredient spills and to reduce downtime associated with human errors. This system utilizes two types of control, Onboard and Traffic Management.</p>
      <p>
        The onboard system takes all of the inputs and outputs and controls the vehicles steering, motion, and communication.The Onboard System is programmed through the vendors assembly language. Because there is no control over the source code internally most
        of the changes are made to the traffic management system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Traffic Managment System recieves status updates from the vehicle and sends commands to the vehicles. The source code for the traffic management system is written in a combination of C, C++, and Pascal. Many modifications have been made in the past
        2 years to reduce the errors on the system by 70%.
      </p>
      <h3>Propellant Machining</h3>
      <p>
        One common method for controlling the burn rate of a solid rocket motor is to adjust the geometry of the exposed propellant. Typically this involves adjusting the number of fins in a motor or maybe just adjusting the size and shape of the fins. Most
        Geometries created can be created using sophisticated (or not) mold set tooling. When the geometry gets to difficult or expensive to cast. Propellant Machining is performed. As one would expect machining explosives is no small feat. Custom machines
        are used with custom control systems designed and devolped internally over the past 30 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Control of this machine is performed using an Allen Bradley Control Logix with a Factory Talk View HMI. The critical parameters in this system are the speeds, feeds, temperatures, and cooling air/water. Additional Permissives are monitored to detect fires,
        flashes, watchdogs, loss or drop in process parameters.
