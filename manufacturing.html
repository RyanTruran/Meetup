    <h3>AGV System</h3>
      <p>
        Explosive Ingredient Delivery System that is used to minimize human exposure to spills
        and to reduce downtime associated with human errors. This system utilizes two types of
        control, Onboard and Traffic Management.

        The onboard system takes all of the inputs and outputs and controls the vehicles steering,
        motion, and communication.The Onboard System is programmed through the vendors assembly
        language. Because there is no control over the source code internally most of the changes
        are made to the traffic management system.

        The Traffic Managment System recieves status updates from the vehicle and sends commands
        to the vehicles. The source code for the traffic management system is written in a
        combination of C, C++, and Pascal. Many modifications have been made in the past 2 years
        to reduce the errors on the system by 70%.
