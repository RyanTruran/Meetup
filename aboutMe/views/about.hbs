    <h3>
      Summary
    </h3>

    <p>
      For the past 3 years, I have worked as an engineer Automating tasks to
      simplify the jobs of those around me. I have turned a countless number of
      thoughts into usable software, from a CLI application that interfaces an
      API to calculate an estimated commute time, an iOS app to keep track of
      timecards, or a simple modificaion to legacy code that allows for a proper
      response when a hardware problem occurs.
    </p>

    <p>
      My degree is in Mechanical engineering which is something that I think
      makes me stand out. I am good at looking at problems holistically and
      determining the root cause of the problems.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I am progressing through my career I find it harder and harder to work
      in environments where my time must be shared between mechanical systems
      and software development. All of my time outside of work is being consumed
      by software and I need to make the change.
    </p>

    <h3>
      Accomplishments
    </h3>

    <p>
      Most of my experience comes from fixing bugs on a vehicle system manager
      that was used at an explosives plant. one of my most notable projects was
      the automation of problem reports. These reports were previously filled
      out by hand after every alarm occurred. This became quite a tedious task
      and as a result the info that we received was lacking. Most of the data
      that was needed was already provided on the screen but not captured at the
      time of the alarm. My solution was to capture all of the events and store
      them in a SQL database that I built. Additionally I added a user interface
      for vieweing the reports in a much more user friendly manner.
    </p>

    <p>
      Another notable project was with a paging system that I built. I built a
      notification system from scratch that read the battery status on all of
      the vehicles and paged the operators phones and emails when a vehicle
      needed a battery change. After a specified time and number of pages, the
      system would escalate the status.
    </p>

    <p>
      The software changes that I have worked on in the past have been primarily
      focused on the back end in c++. But I have recently been working
      full-stack for side projects (like this site). More details can be found
      on the <a href="/projects">projects</a> tab.

    <h3>
    Desires
    </h3>
    <p>
      Over the past few months I have really started diving into the Model View
      Controller, or MVC, concept and the power that it has through routing for
      both rendering web pages and for building API's. I was first exposed to
      MVC while working on the Odin Project a boot camp like course for learning
      Ruby on Rails.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Javascript going full stack I figured why not learn nodejs. With the
      highly modular design of node, it's hard to even comprehend its power.
      This is quickly becoming my favorite language to code in.
    </p>
    <p>
      This new found love for MVC and node is hard to surpress making it quite
      hard for me to be in an environment that doesn't solely focus on software.
