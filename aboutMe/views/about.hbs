    <h3>
      Summary
    </h3>
    <p>
      For the past 3 years I have worked as an engineer Automating tasks to
      simplify the jobs of those around me. I have turned a countless number of
      thoughts into usable software, from a cli application that interfaces an
      api to calculate a estimated commute time, an iOS app to keep track of
      timecards, or a simple change to aid in the proper response when a
      hardware problem occurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      My degree is in Mechanical engineering which is something that I think
      makes me stand out. I am good at looking at problems holistically and
      determining the root cause of the problems.
    </p>
    <p>
      As I am progressing through my career i find it harder and harder to work
      in environments where my time must be shared between mechanical systems
      and software development. All of my time outside of work is being consumed
      by software and I need to make the change.

    <h3>
      Acomplishments
    </h3>
    <p>
      I have worked on several systems containing legacy code.
    </p>
    <p>
      This technique allowed me to drive down errors on an automated guidance vehicle system by about 40%.
